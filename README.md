# ViM Quickstart 
This is my preferred vim configuration. I considered adding plugins but chose to keep it simple and portable at the end.

Enjoy.

## Usage
* Copy `.vimrc` to `~` to enable pre-configured settings.
* Copy `gruvbox.vim` to `~/.vim/colors/` to enable the theme.
* Create `~/.vim/ftpligin/<filetype>.vim` to customise config for specific filetypes.
