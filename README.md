# ViM Quickstart 
This is my preferred vim configuration. I considered adding plugins but chose to keep it simple and portable at the end.

Enjoy.

## Usage
* Copy `.vimrc` to `~` to enable pre-configured settings.
* Create `~/.vim/undo` directory to enable persistent undo. 
* Create `~/.vim/tmp` directory to set it as backup directory. 
* Create `~/.vim/colors/` directory and copy `gruvbox.vim` into it to enable theme.
* Create `~/.vim/ftpligin/<filetype>.vim` files to customise config for specific filetypes.
